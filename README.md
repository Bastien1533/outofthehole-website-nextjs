# Out of The Hole NextJs Website 

(WIP) You can create a `.env.local` file with a `SECRET_KEY` field in order to bypass github's api rate limiting.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Todo:
- Github Api Key Support
- Dynamic Download link
- Presentation, News and Gallery Pages
- Dark Mode (Maybe?)
